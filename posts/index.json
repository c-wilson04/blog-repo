He explained that every engineering team eventually hits a “speed limit,” but instead of adjusting and slowing down, orgs keep pushing harder.\n\nThat’s when he brought up guardrails — the safety mechanisms (like code reviews, tests, fail-safes, redundancy, QA) that slow things down a little but prevent catastrophe. The importance of slowing down now a days means a lot if you are to make sue you're providing quality over quantity but also functionality and what the customer wants instead of what they \"might\" want at a fast pace of delivery. \n\nHe took the time to list actual catastrophes:\n\n### The Knight Capital Meltdown\n\nA single untested algorithmic path caused Knight Capital (American global financial services firm in 2012 ) to lose hundreds of millions in minutes.\n\nWhy?\n\nNo guardrails + extreme speed expectations. They traded equities at a fast pace, but because of high speed trading one algorithmic fail for a short amount of time resulted in huge financial losses which eventually broke the company.\n\n### The Boeing 737 Max Failure  \n  \nTo cut costs and remain competitive in the commercial plane industry, Boeing replaced multiple physical sensors with one, and relied on software to “correct” the missing redundancy and hardware. Worse:  \n- software was rushed\n- outsourced\n- barely QA’d\n- built under “beat the competitor” pressure\n\nIt was the perfect example of the velocity trap: speed won, safety lost. This resulted in the plane crashing on two different occasions with 346 people dead in less than five months.\n\n### Burnout as a Systemic Issue\n\n“82% of people in tech are burned out — not quitting, just working burned out.”\n\nThis number seems imaginary but as someone in the tech industry I can back this claim, as I'm part of the statistics and many I know of are as well. Speed to deliver is a KPI where you must meet your quota in a company, but guess what happens when you meet your quota: \n\nIt goes up and so does the demand. \n\nThis is bound to create burn out and even poor quality which can only be matched by increasing the numbers of people involved in the projects which has many issues of it's own. Then he tied that to something people don’t talk about enough and has a huge impact on the current job market:\n\nNeglecting Junior Developers\n\nJunior devs “slow things down,” so companies avoid investing in them — but that creates a future talent collapse.\n\nA system with no junior dev pipeline is a system with no future architects. A future that will slow down and come to a halt until eventually the gap is remedied and filled. Everyone who is working now will not be working forever, so it's important to invest in junior talent. \n\n---\n\n## Breakout Session 1: AI + Test Driven Development — A Better Partnership Than People Think\n\nCody Frenzel, Solutions Architect at Ippon, lead this breakout session tackling TDD (Test-Driven Development) in the age of AI.\n\nMost people misunderstand TDD as “write tests first,”\n\nbut really it’s:\n\n1. Form a hypothesis about how something should behave\n2. Express that hypothesis as a test\n3. Write code that makes the test pass\n4. Iterate on code until behavior is correct\n\nAnd here’s the twist:\n\nAI loves this structure. Tests Become Guardrails for AI.\n\nCody explained something very interesting:\n\nLeft alone, AI might hallucinate or generate the wrong approach when left to code features.\n\nBut when you have tests — especially using F.I.R.S.T. principles (Fast, Independent, Repeatable, Self-validating, Timely) — the AI is forced into correct behavior. Your tests define the boundaries. The AI fills in the implementation. It feels less like “AI is coding for me” and more like:\n\nAI is the junior developer, and tests are the instructions. \n(We still love the Jr Devs...Don't be mad just an example :) )\n\n---\n  \n## Breakout Session 2: Functional Core, Imperative Shell — The Most Eye-Opening Technical Talk\n\nNow this part stole the whole event for me. Jesse Warden, Tech Lead at  Capital One, introduced a pattern called Functional Core, Imperative Shell, and the room leaned in like they already knew this mattered.\n\nThe Core Idea:\n  \n“Put your pure logic in the center, and push all the messy stuff to the edges.”\n\nFunctional Core = pure logic\n\n- No side effects.\n- No mutations.\n- No async.\n- No exceptions thrown.\n\nJust pure input → output functions.\n\nPure functions give the same output every time for the same input, which makes them easy to test and impossible to “randomly break.”\n  \nImperative Shell = everything mess\n\nAll the stuff that can’t be pure:\n\n- database queries\n- network calls\n- file operations\n- user interaction\n- async/await\n- error propagation\n\nThese are called side effects — any observable change to the outside world. They’re unpredictable, so keeping them out of the core gives you a stable, error-resistant architecture.\n\nWhy this matters\n\nFunctional domain logic:\n\n- is easier to test\n- survives refactoring\n- is immune to hidden crashes\n- scales safely\n\nThis helps keep things like random unexpected inputs from the outside world into your program edge case tested foe those parts, but pure logic bing tested for exactly what is was made for with no confusion and overlap of responsibility. Jesse even mentioned Cloudflare’s most recent (Nov. 18, 2025) now-famous outage caused by a single innocuous .unwrap() — a reminder that one side effect in the wrong place can break an entire global network.\n\nThen came one of the funniest but real world examples:\n\nThe Kroger barcode/card scanning exploit.\n\nWhen customers scanned their items and loyalty cards rapidly, the system's imperative logic and state management were unable to keep up, leading to unexpected behaviors such as applying discounts (Should've got it before they patched it). The sequence of operations processed by the system exceeded its designed capacity for handling rapid inputs.\n\nFunctional architecture avoids these assumptions entirely and keeps code testable and easily edge case proof or at least recognizable in situations of error. \n\n---\n\n## NVIDIA’s AI Keynote — Practical, Not Hype  \n\nDuring an insightful presentation, **Jessica Clark from NVIDIA** unveiled a range of tools aimed at simplifying AI application development. Instead of the often-repeated mantra that \"AI is the future,\" the message was refreshingly practical: **“Here are the tools. You can build with them today.”**\n\n### Key Offerings\n\nNVIDIA is providing developers with several valuable resources:\n\n- **Foundation Models**: Pre-trained models that can be adapted for various applications, reducing the need to start training from scratch—something that can cost millions.\n    \n- **Pre-Built Blueprints**: Ready-made templates guide developers in implementing AI systems efficiently and effectively.\n    \n- **Sandbox Environments**: Controlled environments allow developers to experiment with AI models without the risks associated with production systems.\n    \n- **Reference Architectures**: Documentation and frameworks that guide the architecture of AI systems, ensuring scalability and best practices.\n    \n\n### Efficient Utilization of Resources\n\nClark emphasized that most companies should not attempt to train foundation models from scratch due to the immense costs involved. Instead, developers can utilize NVIDIA’s **sandbox environments** and pre-trained models, allowing them to customize and adapt these resources to fit their specific needs.\n\nThis approach is designed to streamline the development process, making it more accessible for a wider range of companies and developers looking to leverage AI technology effectively and affordably.\n\n---\n\n## Data Gone in 60 Seconds — A Serverless ETL Heist\n\nPaul Chin, Senior Serverless Developer at Serverless Guru, had a talk that had the whole room engaged.\n\nHe built an entire story around a serverless, event-driven ETL(Extract - Transform - Load) pipeline, describing it like a heist movie — but technically accurate\n\nKey Concepts Explained:\n\n- Serverless: You don’t manage servers; AWS runs your code automatically.\n- Event-driven: Functions trigger on events (file uploaded, message sent).\n- IaC (Infrastructure as Code): Instead of clicking buttons in AWS, you write configuration files that define your cloud environment.\n- Encryption > Obfuscation: hiding something isn’t security; encrypting it is.\n\nThis whole pipeline was:\n\n- scalable\n- cost efficient\n- secure\n- decoupled\n- observable\n\nAnd it worked like a high-speed data extraction-and-transform machine.\n\n---\n\n## Leadership in the AI Age — Humans Still Matter\n\nThis was a panel by an incredible lineup featuring:  \n- Richmond Mayor **Danny Avula**  \n- **Ankit Mathur**, Chief Technology Officer | United Network for Organ Sharing  \n- **Diane Schnupp**, EVP & CIO | Kinsale Insurance  \n- Moderated by the dynamic **Michael Ghaffari**, Senior Director of Engineering | United Network for Organ Sharing  \n\nTogether, they opened our eyes to the exciting potentials of AI and how it can enhance our lives and work. This session reminded us that at the heart of every innovation, it’s the people that truly matter.\n\nCompanies today are facing a capacity problem — there’s more work than available people, and the complexity is often beyond what teams can handle manually. **The good news?** AI can step in to fill that gap, but it requires trust from leadership to make it happen.\n\nThey introduced a fascinating concept: **expertise transformation.** When AI takes over certain tasks, people don’t just fade away; instead, their expertise shifts to a new layer, allowing them to focus on higher-level functions. This is just like what happened historically with:\n\n- **Industrial Machinery**\n- **Calculators**\n- **Spreadsheets**\n- **The Internet**\n\nAI is simply the next wave in this ongoing evolution.\n\n---\n\n## As I Left the Building…\n\nWalking out, I realized that Code and Cloud wasn’t just another tech hype event; it felt like a much-needed course correction. It served as a vital reminder that:\n\n- Speed is useless without safety.\n- Tests are more than just bug catchers; they’re essential for quality assurance.\n- Functional architecture is crucial to prevent chaos.\n- While AI accelerates good engineering, it also reveals bad engineering practices.\n- Technology without a focus on human problems is just noise.\n\nThis conference stood apart as a rare chance to view tech not as a competitive race but as a craft — one that carries a shared responsibility.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn a world increasingly shaped by AI, it’s essential to keep our focus on human expertise and meaningful collaboration. As leaders, embracing the balance between technological innovation and human involvement is critical. By viewing AI as a tool to enhance our capabilities rather than replace them, we can create a vibrant future where technology enriches the human experience. This perspective will be vital as we navigate the complexities of the AI-driven landscape ahead.\n\n---"
